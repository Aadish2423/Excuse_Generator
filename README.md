The AI-Powered Excuse Generator is a smart, multimodal application designed to generate realistic, context-aware excuses using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It helps users quickly create professional and believable excuses for work, academics, or personal situations—without sounding repetitive or artificial.

Unlike basic template-based generators, this system understands intent, scenario, and tone, allowing it to generate human-like responses tailored to specific situations. The application also supports formal proof generation (such as company-style leave notes in PDF format), making the output suitable for real-world use.

Built with a clean and user-friendly GUI using customTkinter, the project demonstrates practical AI integration, combining language models, NLP pipelines, and document automation into a single cohesive system.
